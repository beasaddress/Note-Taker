## Description
This note-taker application uses Express.js to the backend to read data from a JSON file and display it to the user. The user clicks a "Get Started" button and is able to make notes (with their own respective titles) and add them to a storage field on the side of the page. Once a note is added to the field, they are able to make additional notes as well. Here is a link to the deployed application: https://stormy-oasis-58653-6cd8d72dfb3f.herokuapp.com/
